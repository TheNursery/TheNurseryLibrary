TheNurseryLibrary
=================

This is a library of stupid scripts made my members of the GR ballbags. It uses
a version control software called [git](http://git-scm.com/). If you have never
heard of this before then maybe take a look at [this helpful
tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). If you just want to see
the script ignore this and follow instructions.

# Instructions

* To clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/TheNursery/TheNurseryLibrary.git
$ cd TheNurseryLibrary/
```

* If you want to add your own script

```
$ git add myscript.sh myotherscript.sh
$ git commit -m "Adds myscript which does .. "
```

* You could also modify other peoples scripts using this.
