TheNurseryLibrary
=================

This is a library of stupid scripts made my members of the GR ballbags. It uses
a version control software called [git](http://git-scm.com/). If you have never
heard of this before then maybe take a look at [this helpful
tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). If you just want to see
the script ignore this and follow instructions.

# Instructions

To clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheNursery/TheNurseryLibrary.git
cd TheNurseryLibrary/
```

If you want to add your own script

```sh
git add myscript.sh myotherscript.sh
git commit -m "Adds myscript which does .. "
```

To push the changed to the remote repo you need to [create a git hub account](https://github.com/)
then ask any of the current contributors to add you. Once you have the access simply push your commit by

```sh
git push origin master
``` 
This will ask your username and password (of your github account)
